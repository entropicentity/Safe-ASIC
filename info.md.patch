-Connect the first four inputs to the signals from the four rows in order of the membrane keypad
+Connect the bidirectional I/O pins 4-7 (uio[4:7]) to the signals from the four rows in order of the membrane keypad
 
-connect the first three outputs to the first or only three columns of the membrane keypad
+connect the bidirectional I/O pins 0-2 (uio[0:2]) to the first or only three columns of the membrane keypad
 
-connect the fourth output to the power transistor driving the solenoid
+connect the first output pin (uo[0]) to the power transistor driving the solenoid
 
-connect the fifth and sixth output pins to the green and blue LEDs respectively
+connect the second and third output pins (uo[1] and uo[2]) to the green and blue LEDs respectively
